# Sustainable Agriculture: AI-Based Crop Disease Detection and Advisory System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered system** that detects crop diseases from leaf images and provides actionable advisory suggestions to farmers. Leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning**, the system is designed to deliver high accuracy and real-world usability. In future iterations, it can be deployed as a **web application** for easy access by farmers.

## Objectives
- Detect crop diseases accurately using deep learning.
- Provide actionable recommendations for disease management.
- Create a scalable and extendable codebase for future enhancements.

## Dataset
- **PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle)**  
  Contains 50,000+ labeled images of various crop leaves and diseases.

## Week 1 Milestone / Improvisations
- Added disease advisory suggestions along with detection for practical usage.
- Designed a **flexible project structure** for future web app deployment.
- Planned to use **Transfer Learning** (ResNet / MobileNet) to achieve better accuracy with smaller datasets.


## Next Steps
- Implement data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Build and train CNN / Transfer Learning models.
- Evaluate model performance and optimize accuracy.
- Deploy a simple web interface for farmers to upload images and get disease predictions.
